# EC463_minipro
Development of an app in React Native Expo to scan and read a barcode with firebase authentication and database

Changes to codebase and programming can be found in the Peter and John branches, final changes will be applied in master branch. 

# DevLog / Goals

## Day1 9/8/2021
Installed development tools, including Node, Expo CLI and Android Studio. Configured android studio emulator with expo and tested to make sure we can open hello world style apps in the emulator.

## Day2 9/10/2021
Worked remotely to setup Firebase with React Native (John) and Firebase with Expo (Peter). Started to configure a barcode scanner with expo as well as Google authentication in firebase using the android SHA1 key and package name. 

## Day3 9/11/2021
Found a working case for the barcode scanner and implemented firebase and authentication. Started developing frontend UI and screen navigational logic for our final app.

## Day4 9/12/2021
Configured cloud firestore as our database (not using realtime database). Connected our barcode scanner and authentication components into our final app. Added navigational buttons to switch between screens. Have a working authentication + scanner app. Still to do: implement data transfer ability between firebase and our app, spruce up UI and make it look professional. Screenshots of our progress will be uploaded today.
